Clone this repository

Run vagrant up within this repository folder (this will bring homestead up).

Deployments are done only by me via a secret key - want your code deployed please message me.

Do not try to merge directly to master - new feature? Create an issue - I will than create a branch for you - if your code passes
my tests then I will merge to master and deploy. We will follow feature branching to a tee.

If code is not unit tested don't even attempt to PR it.
